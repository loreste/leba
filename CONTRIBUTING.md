# Contributing to LEBA

We love your input! We want to make contributing to LEBA as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable type prefix:
    * feat: A new feature
    * fix: A bug fix
    * docs: Documentation only changes
    * style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
    * refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    * perf: A code change that improves performance
    * test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    * chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Code Style

* Follow standard Go formatting (use `go fmt`)
* Run `go vet` and `golint` before submitting PRs
* Write meaningful, descriptive commit messages
* Include comments that help others understand your code's purpose and functionality
